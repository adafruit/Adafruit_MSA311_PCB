### Description

The MSA311 is a super small and low-cost triple-axis accelerometer. It's inexpensive, but has just about every 'extra' you'd want in an accelerometer:

* Three-axis sensing, 14-bit resolution
* ±2g/±4g/±8g/±16g selectable scaling
* I2C interface on fixed I2C address 0x62
* Interrupt output
* Multiple data rate options 1 Hz to 500 Hz
* As low as 2uA current draw in low power mode (just the chip itself, not including any supporting circuitry)
* Tap, Double-tap, orientation & freefall detection

The MSA311 is very similar to the MSA301, but is not a drop-in replacement. The I2C address has changed from 0x26 to 0x62!
